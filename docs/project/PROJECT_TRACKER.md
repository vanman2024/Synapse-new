## Link to Claude Compact Summaries

For detailed discussions, design decisions, and implementation details, refer to the Claude compact summaries:

- Location: `/sessions/claude/compact-YYYYMMDD.md`
- Access via: `cat ./sessions/claude/compact-$(date +"%Y%m%d").md`
- Watch script: `./start-compact-watch.sh`

These summaries complement this tracker by providing the "how" and "why" behind development decisions, while this tracker focuses on the "what" and "when" of progress.
