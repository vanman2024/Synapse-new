# Project Management Documentation

This directory contains all project management and tracking documents for the Synapse project.

## Key Documents

- **[PROJECT_TRACKER.md](./PROJECT_TRACKER.md)** - Central project tracking document (start here)
- **[MODULE_TRACKER.md](./MODULE_TRACKER.md)** - Detailed module status and development tracking
- **[DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](./DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)** - Overall development phases and roadmap
- **[PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md](./PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md)** - Project structure and organization

## Integration with Claude Compact Summaries

These project management documents work hand-in-hand with the Claude compact summaries:

| Project Management Documents | Claude Compact Summaries |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Focus on "what" and "when"   | Focus on "how" and "why"  |
| Track progress & status      | Record detailed discussions |
| High-level planning          | Implementation details    |
| Task priorities              | Design decisions          |
| Located in `/docs/project/`  | Located in `/sessions/claude/` |

Together, they provide a complete picture of the project's development:
1. Use these documents to see what needs to be worked on next
2. Refer to compact summaries for the detailed context of past work
3. Use both when working with Claude to maintain continuity

## Using These Documents

The [PROJECT_TRACKER.md](./PROJECT_TRACKER.md) serves as the entry point and provides a quick overview of the current status, while the other documents provide more detailed information for specific aspects of the project.
