# Session Archives

This directory contains archived activities from SESSION.md to prevent file bloat.

Archives are automatically created when SESSION.md grows beyond 300 lines, preserving older activity records while keeping the main SESSION.md file manageable.

## Archive Format

Each archive file is named according to the date when it was created:
```
session_YYYYMMDD.md
```

The contents include:
- A header with the archive date
- Sections for each activity period
- The same formatting as used in SESSION.md

## Accessing Archives

To review older activity history, simply browse the archive files in this directory. They are sorted by date, with the most recent archives appearing first in the file listing.

Archives are automatically created and managed by the `auto-session-tracker.sh` script. You should not need to manually edit or manage these files.
