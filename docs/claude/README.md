# Claude AI Development Guide

This directory contains documentation specifically for Claude AI when working on the Synapse project.

## Key Documents

- [CLAUDE_DEVELOPMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./CLAUDE_DEVELOPMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) - Comprehensive development guidelines for Claude
- [MODULE_TRACKER.md](./MODULE_TRACKER.md) - High-level project modules and development roadmap

## Purpose

The documentation in this directory serves as a reference for Claude AI during development sessions. It contains:

- Development standards and best practices
- Code style and architectural guidelines
- Testing requirements and processes
- Communication protocols
- Project-specific instructions

## Usage

At the beginning of each development session, Claude will review these documents alongside SESSION.md to ensure continuity and adherence to development standards.

The documentation here complements the workflow documentation found in `/docs/workflow/` which focuses on the automated session management system.

## Updating Guidelines

As the project evolves, these guidelines should be updated to reflect new requirements, patterns, or lessons learned. When significant changes are made to the development approach, these documents should be updated to ensure Claude has the most current information.
