## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| 2025-03-12 | Use repository pattern | Provides abstraction over data sources | Direct data access, ORM |
| 2025-03-12 | Implement TDD workflow | Ensures code quality and testability | Manual testing, test-after |
| 2025-03-12 | Modular architecture | Enables independent development of components | Monolithic design |
| 2025-03-14 | Simplified workflow tooling | Improves development velocity with automated scripts | Manual workflow processes |
| 2025-03-14 | Focus on Content Generation first | Delivers core value proposition early | Building UI or distribution first |

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Content Generation Pipeline**
   - Focus on building robust content repository and generation capabilities
   - Complete OpenAI integration for text and image generation
   - Implement content storage and retrieval systems

2. **Brand & Styling System**
   - Enhance brand theme extraction and application
   - Build efficient text overlay capabilities
   - Create consistent visual styling across generated content

3. **Workflow Automation**
   - Develop approval processes with minimal manual intervention
   - Implement distribution scheduling and tracking
   - Integrate with external platforms through Make.com

## Development Principles

- **API-First Development**: Focus on robust API layer before UI components
- **Test-Driven Development**: Each module must have comprehensive tests
- **Modular Design**: Components should be independently deployable
- **Performance Monitoring**: Build with observability from the start
- **Security By Design**: Implement proper authentication and data protection
