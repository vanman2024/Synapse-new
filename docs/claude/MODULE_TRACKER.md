- **Brand Style System** → **Style Applicator** → **Image Processing**
- **Approval Service** → **Feedback Handler** → **Content Service**
- **Scheduling Service** → **Make.com Integration** → External platforms

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| 2025-03-12 | Use repository pattern | Provides abstraction over data sources | Direct data access, ORM |
| 2025-03-12 | Implement TDD workflow | Ensures code quality and testability | Manual testing, test-after |
| 2025-03-12 | Modular architecture | Enables independent development of components | Monolithic design |

## Notes

- Priority order: Content Generation → Text Overlay → Approval → Distribution
- Focus on core functionality before UI components
- Each module should have comprehensive tests before moving to the next
- Weekly goals should align with one or more complete modules
