# Session Workflow Improvements

This document outlines specific enhancements to our Claude AI session management workflow system.

## Current Workflow Components

Our automated session management system currently includes:
- Auto-commit with 5-minute intervals
- SESSION.md for tracking progress
- Git hooks for maintaining session continuity
- Automated context review at session start
- Feature branch management tools

## Potential Enhancements

### 1. Session Initialization Improvements

- **Prioritized Context Loading**
  - Modify claude-start.sh to scan SESSION.md and identify most relevant files
  - Automatically display snippets of key files mentioned in last activity
  - Create a score-based system to determine which context is most important

- **Sprint Awareness**
  - Add sprint/milestone tracking to SESSION.md
  - Have claude-start.sh show progress toward sprint goals
  - Flag items that are falling behind schedule

### 2. Session Content Management

- **Cleaner SESSION.md Structure**
  - Implement collapsible sections in SESSION.md
  - Auto-archive older activity to prevent file bloat
  - Create visual separators between sessions

- **Focused Activity Tracking**
  - Track time spent on different components/features
  - Generate session summaries with key metrics (files changed, lines added/removed)
  - Create linkage between SESSION.md entries and commit history

### 3. Communication Enhancements

- **Standardized Command Format**
  - Create a simple DSL for common operations (e.g., `@focus: component-name`)
  - Build shortcuts for frequently used commands
  - Add command completion hints to SESSION.md

- **Status Reporting**
  - Add automated end-of-session summary generation
  - Create weekly progress reports based on SESSION.md history
  - Generate stakeholder-friendly status updates

### 4. Automation Refinements

- **Smarter Auto-commit**
  - Add .autocommitignore file to exclude certain files/patterns
  - Create logical grouping of related changes
  - Add change type detection (feature, bugfix, refactor)

- **SESSION.md Version Control**
  - Maintain history of SESSION.md changes
  - Implement conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
  - Add "checkpoint" system for marking significant milestones

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Workflow Refinements
1. Implement .autocommitignore functionality
2. Add sprint awareness to SESSION.md
3. Create automated session summaries

### Phase 2: User Experience Improvements
1. Develop standardized command format
2. Implement collapsible sections in SESSION.md
3. Build prioritized context loading

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Add change type detection
2. Build status reporting
3. Implement time tracking

## Expected Benefits

- **Reduced Context Switching Cost**
  - 30-40% less time spent rediscovering context at session start
  - Faster identification of relevant code and documentation

- **Improved Progress Tracking**
  - More accurate understanding of project velocity
  - Better resource allocation based on work patterns
  - Enhanced stakeholder communication

- **Higher Quality Collaboration**
  - More consistent communication with Claude
  - Reduced misunderstandings through standardized commands
  - Better organization of complex tasks across multiple sessions
