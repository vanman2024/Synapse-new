# Create a sample compact summary
echo "Creating example compact summary file..."
cat > "$WATCH_DIR/example-summary-$DATE-$TIME.txt" << 'SUMMARY'
<summary>
This is an example compact summary from the demonstration script.

1. The auto-compact-watch.sh script watches the compact-watch directory
2. When you save a file containing <summary> tags to this directory, 
   it automatically processes and saves it to the daily compact file
3. Multiple summaries on the same day are appended to the same file
4. Each summary gets a timestamp and separator for better organization
5. No manual copy/paste required\!

This provides a fully automated system for saving Claude's compact summaries.
