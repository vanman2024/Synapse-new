# Deprecated Claude Scripts

These scripts have been replaced by the new simplified compact summary system:

- `/scripts/workflow/claude/auto-compact-watch.sh` - Main watcher script
- `/scripts/workflow/claude/save-compact-simple.sh` - Manual save alternative
- `/scripts/save-session.sh` - Core save functionality

The new system provides a simpler approach with a single file per day for all
compact summaries, and clearer separation from the development workflow.

These archived scripts are kept for reference only and should not be used.
