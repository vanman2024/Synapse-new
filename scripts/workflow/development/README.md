# Development Session Management Scripts

These scripts manage the development workflow and session tracking in SESSION.md.

## Key Scripts

- `session-archive.sh` - Archive older development sessions
- `session-manager.sh` - Manage development sessions
- `start-session.sh` - Start a new development session
- `session-end.sh` - End a development session

These scripts are solely focused on tracking actual code development progress
and are completely separate from Claude conversation tracking.
