# Claude Conversation Tracking Scripts

These scripts manage Claude's compact summaries - NOT development progress.

## Key Scripts

- `auto-compact-watch.sh` - Watch for and process compact summaries
- `save-compact-simple.sh` - Manual method to save summaries

These scripts focus solely on preserving Claude conversations, separate
from the actual development tracking system.
